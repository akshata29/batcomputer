# Project Batcomputer
Project Batcomputer is a working example of DevOps applied to Machine Learning

Motivations:
- Understand challenges in operationisation of ML models
- Existing processes (e.g. Azure Machine Learning Service) deemed problematic
- “DevOps for AI”

The source data is from here: [Police recorded crime and outcomes open data tables](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-recorded-crime-open-data-tables), the model is intended to predict the outcome of a given crime in a given region etc.

Full background and documentation can be found in the [provided slides](docs/Project Batcomputer v0.0.2.pdf)
